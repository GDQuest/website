frustrated reply?</strong> </p><p>You're not alone! </p><p>At some point in your gamedev journey, you'll hit a roadblock and need help. This video shows you how to ask questions in a way that increases your chances of getting useful answers. It's part of the onboarding modules of <a href="https://school.gdquest.com">GDQuest's Gamedev Curriculum</a> and one of the first habits we encourage our students to build when they set out to make games!</p><div class="videoEmbed video-youtube"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HBJg1v53QVA" title="Video" width="560" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" allowFullscreen="allowFullscreen" frameBorder="0"></iframe></div><figure class="quoteBubble"><blockquote class="quoteBubbleContents"><p>The people you ask are human.</p><p>Just like you, they have projects of their own and limited time, and they need enough context to be able to help you. When you just say "it doesn't work" without details, it can be hard to receive support and frustrate both you and the person trying to help.</p><p>When you ask for help, there's one key principle to remember to maximize your chances: <strong>help me help you.</strong>
</p></blockquote><figcaption class="quoteBubbleAuthor"><h4 class="quoteBubbleAuthorName">Nathan</h4><h5 class="quoteBubbleAuthorTitle">Founder and teacher at GDQuest</h5></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-golden-rule-help-me-help-you">The golden rule: Help me help you</h2><p>If you look at <a href="https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z">our Discord</a> or the <a href="https://forum.godotengine.org/">Godot forums</a> for example, you'll find that gamedevs are generous with their time and knowledge and help newcomers when they can.</p><p>But they're not sitting next to you, they can't see your screen or know everything you've done or tried so far. Yet, most programming issues are contextual. That's why you need to give people the right information so they can help you.</p><p>Here are three checks you can do before posting a question. Follow these, and you'll max out your chances of getting help from the community:</p><ol><li>Are you asking in the right place?</li><li>Did you look for an answer?</li><li>Did you provide enough context?</li></ol><p>Let's go through each of these checks one by one.</p><h2 id="check-1-are-you-asking-in-the-right-place">Check 1: Are you asking in the right place?</h2><p>Before you post a question, ask yourself: am I in the right place?</p><p><strong>Here's a good rule of thumb:</strong> Post your question where you would expect to find an answer to it.</p><p>Say you just watched a tutorial and you scroll down to the comments to ask about your own project. If your question isn't related to the tutorial, the comments probably aren't the best place for it.</p><p>People reading the comments want to discuss the tutorial itself. They might have their own questions about what the video covers. Along the way, they might answer your question too, but only if it's relevant to the tutorial.</p><figure class="quoteBubble"><blockquote class="quoteBubbleContents"><p>Look for relevant threads, channels, and tutorials. This helps in two ways. First, someone is more likely to answer you. Second, other people with the same problem can find the answer later!</p><p>Also, read the room! Spend a little time reading posts and getting a feel for the place. Some forums are laid-back, others have specific rules. Look for those rules. If you skip them, people might see you as someone who doesn't really care about the community, so why would they put in the time to help you?
</p></blockquote><figcaption class="quoteBubbleAuthor"><h4 class="quoteBubbleAuthorName">Nathan</h4><h5 class="quoteBubbleAuthorTitle">Founder and teacher at GDQuest</h5></figcaption></figure><h2 id="check-2-did-you-look-for-an-answer">Check 2: Did you look for an answer?</h2><p>You don't need to know if your question is common or rare, don't worry about that. But it saves everyone time if you search for an answer before asking. Someone might have already gotten a great answer to the same question or a similar one.</p><p>You can try any of these methods to search for an answer:</p><ul><li>Search a few relevant keywords in your search engine: "Godot coding attacks" or "Godot 3d third person player movement"</li><li>Find the main topic or game mechanic your question is about and look up relevant YouTube videos to see if someone asked your question in the comments</li><li>Check help requests in the Godot forum, on Reddit, or in the help channels on the Godot Discord or GDQuest Discord</li><li>If you suspect a bug in Godot itself, <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">look up open issues</a> in the Godot project on GitHub to see if someone reported it</li></ul><p>Searching first saves you time and shows good citizenship in your community. Plus, reading other people's questions and answers helps you learn faster.</p><figure class="quoteBubble"><blockquote class="quoteBubbleContents"><p>When you find a good answer, you can share the link the next time someone asks. Or you could answer them yourself! Helping others is actually a great way to get answers yourself. It shows goodwill and proves you're not just here to take, you're willing to give too.</p><p>Plus, teaching is a great way to learn! Even if you're a beginner, you always know something that someone else doesn't.
</p></blockquote><figcaption class="quoteBubbleAuthor"><h4 class="quoteBubbleAuthorName">Nathan</h4><h5 class="quoteBubbleAuthorTitle">Founder and teacher at GDQuest</h5></figcaption></figure><p>One more thing: you might not always get answers fast, because people are not always around or may not know about your specific problem. While you wait, look for chances to help others! And remember to be patient and ready to work on something else in the meantime.</p><h2 id="check-3-did-you-provide-enough-context">Check 3: Did you provide enough context?</h2><p>This is the most important check. Never skip this one: Gamedev problems are contextual. The more context you give, the easier it is for someone to help you.</p><p>People aren't in your head or sitting next to you. They haven't been dealing with your problem alongside you. So they need you to bridge that gap.</p><p><strong>Just describing what went wrong won't get you answers.</strong> Avoid vague complaints like:</p><ul><li>"This doesn't work, I hate it"</li><li>"My character won't move, why?"</li><li>"Godot sucks"</li></ul><p>People simply can't help with something too short like this.</p><p>But <strong>giving details doesn't mean writing an essay</strong>. Try to be clear and complete, while keeping it short. Here's what to include:</p><ul><li>What you're trying to do: Describe your goal clearly</li><li>What you've tried: Explain the steps you already took</li><li>What actually happens: Describe the specific problem or error you see</li><li>Your setup: Mention your Godot version, operating system, and any relevant project settings</li><li>Code or screenshots: Share the relevant code or a screenshot that shows the problem</li></ul><figure class="quoteBubble"><blockquote class="quoteBubbleContents"><p>The more context you give upfront, the easier it is for someone to understand your problem and give you a helpful answer.</p><p>You don't have to give <em>all</em> this information <em>every time</em>. Sharing all the relevant code and the problem is the most important starting point. Then, the more specific details you can add, the better.
</p></blockquote><figcaption class="quoteBubbleAuthor"><h4 class="quoteBubbleAuthorName">Nathan</h4><h5 class="quoteBubbleAuthorTitle">Founder and teacher at GDQuest</h5></figcaption></figure><p>People can be incredibly generous with their time and knowledge when you follow these steps.
