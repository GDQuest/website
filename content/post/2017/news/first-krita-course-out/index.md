After months of work, the Make Professional Painterly Game Art with Krita course is out!

It's the first and only Krita course about 2d game art. I took the time to explain the workflow and techniques I use in my work as a professional designer.

In this course, you will learn:

- How to create smart, reusable game sprites
- How to make your own game characters and environment
- You will improve your art fundamentals (Pro and Premium)
- You will acquire new tricks to work efficiently with Krita (Pro and Premium)

## What's in it? How much does it cost?

In total, there are about 30 video tutorials and 15 PDF documents depending on the version you want to get. The course comes in 3 versions to fit your budget and your needs: 

- Essentials (9.95 EUR), the game sprite creation tutorials
- Pro (24.95 EUR), adds fundamental art training, techniques to create nondestructive selections in Krita, and art demos based on the games Pankapu and Seasons: After Fall
- Premium (49.95 EUR), for those who want the full value. On top of exclusive tutorials, it gives you access to the premium-only Discord chat, priority support, step by step assignments and 2 PDF course documents

I'm confident it'll help you get your art to the next level. So confident you have a 30 days money-back guarantee! If you feel like you didn't learn anything from the course, just drop me a message, and I'll refund your purchase. No questions asked!

You should have some experience with drawing and digital art. The pace and difficulty of the course is similar to the [GDquest Youtube channel](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest).
You also want to know a bit about Krita. My free series will cover everything you need in that regards: [Free Krita tutorial](/tutorial/art/krita-tutorial-for-game-artists/) (50 videos!)
