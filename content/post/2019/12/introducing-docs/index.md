<!-- If this file goes under contents/docs be sure to start chapters with ##, not # -->

Over the past few days we've been working on a new section that brings all our useful guides, like our [GDScript styleguide]({{< ref "docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/index.md" >}}) in one place.

Now, we have a beautiful [docs section]({{< ref "docs/_index.md" >}}) based on the excellent [Hugo learn theme](//learn.netlify.com). This is the first step in a series of improvements we are making to improve your experience on this website.

This theme brings cool features:

- A search bar that gives instant result for the entire website.
- Nested side menu that's easy to navigate on the left-hand side.
- A table of contents that follows to jump around long documents.
- Next and previous buttons on every page to navigate through the menu entries.
- A button to copy code snippets.
- Attachment files.

There, you will find guides like our [Godot learning path for beginners]({{ ref "docs/guides/learn-godot/beginner/index.md" }})

You can find the table of contents at the top of the window. Hover the black icon to see a list of sections to jump to:

That is it for this update. Here are a few insightful guides for you to check out in the new section:

1. [Make Games with Godot: Beginner Edition]({{< ref "docs/guides/learn-godot/beginner/index.md" >}})
1. [Make Games with Godot: Developer Edition]({{< ref "docs/guides/learn-godot/developer/index.md" >}})
1. Our [GDScript styleguide]({{< ref "docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/index.md" >}})

We will keep improving these documents moving forward. Enjoy!
