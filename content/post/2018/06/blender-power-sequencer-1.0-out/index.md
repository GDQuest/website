[Power Sequencer](/blender/power-sequencer) is a **Free add-on** to help Content Creators edit faster with Blender.

The add-on brings over 40 new core editing features to Blender, including:

1. **Instant import** of your video footage, pictures, and audio
1. Smart **mouse-based tools** to cut, trim, remove gaps...
1. Instant fades, crossfade to the next sequence
1. Change the playback speed on the fly
1. Instant render with presets

{{< button "Get Power Sequencer" "//github.com/GDQuest/Blender-power-sequencer/releases" "centered" >}}

It builds upon the great work done on the Blender Velvets and the VSEQF tools, in a project that gets **continuous support**.
We use Blender at GDQuest to edit [all our video tutorials](//youtube.com/c/gdquest).

By creating our own tools we were able to make the workflow faster than with any editing program out there!
And it keeps getting better.

## Getting Started

Get started editing with Blender and Power Sequencer in 30 minutes!

You can learn about [all the features](//github.com/GDQuest/Blender-power-sequencer/#operators) and their shortcuts on the add-on's GitHub page.


## Contributors welcome!

Thanks to Daniel Oakey, who greatly improved the already excellent [VSE Transform tools](//github.com/doakey3/VSE_Transform_Tools), Power Sequencer is easy to contribute to!

Every feature is in its own file, well-separated from the others.

Want to help? Whether it is to give us feedback, fix a bug, add a new feature, or make a tutorial, [get in touch](//github.com/GDQuest/Blender-power-sequencer/issues)! We're here to help you get started.
