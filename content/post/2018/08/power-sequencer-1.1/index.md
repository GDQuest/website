[Power Sequencer]({{< ref "docs/documentation/power-sequencer/_index.md" >}}) is our Free add-on to **edit at the speed of thought** with Blender's Video Sequence Editor.

Version 1.1 improves the editing workflow with new features like:

1. A cross-platform **multithreaded renderer** for the VSE, BPSRender, which fixes bugs existing scripts had
1. A re-written tool to **render proxies from videos**, with a clear progress report
1. **Automatic smart selections** for key tools when you don't have anything selected

And more! You can see all improvements at a glance in the [changelog](https://github.com/GDQuest/Blender-power-sequencer/blob/master/changelog.md)

We now have neat [Power Sequencer reference]({{< ref "docs/documentation/power-sequencer/reference/index.md" >}}) on the website! They're easy to improve, with our auto-generated menu and all the content in markdown. Anyone who would like to contribute to them is more than welcome ☺
