The 4th update of the [ Godot 3 course ](https://gumroad.com/l/godot-tutorial-make-professional-2d-games) is out! It includes the new tilesets and tilemap chapter, along with new videos to flesh out chapter *01.The character controller* and chapter *08.Game pre-production*.

Godot 3 [ just came out ](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-0-released), and with some more work done on the official documentation and a nice collab with Mike from GameFromScratch, I will now focus my efforts fully on the course.

Don’t forget to drop by on Discord to get answers for your questions, to give feedback, etc. The link is in the course’s changelog [ on Gumroad ](official website), where you'll also find detailed release notes.

Note that I am moving house to Nara, Japan, on February 28th.

Since I didn't take much time off since 2016, I'll take some holidays to settle down, meet some friends and do all the paperwork when I land. You will get a new update by then and I'll work hard to bring you at least 2 chapters this time!

See you in the next release,
