The brushes are dry for the most part, so you can easily apply thick paint on the canvas. Need a softer blending effect? Use the I and O keys to tweak your opacity and make the brushes weaker.

I take my time to design the presets and ensure that they are worth adding to the pack. I also use them in my daily work to ensure that they are tested thoroughly in all kinds of configurations.

## Changelog

### Version 9 - Nov 2016

- 10 new presets including a blur tool, splatter brushes, and a rock texture
- 10 natural media presets, and especially a powerful cloud painting tool (premium)
- a new tutorial on cloud painting (premium)

### Version 8 - Nov 2016

- 2 textured rock brushes: these presets will allow you to add 2 types of sharp grain to your rocks, for a more believable look.
- Smear cloud: whether you want to slightly blur or completely diffuse your edges, this is a very efficient preset to do so. It blurs your painting fast and provides very good control.
- Smoke dusty: this brush can be used for both clouds and smoke. Unlike the existing cloud builder brushes, it offers some high frequency details for a richer look.
- 2 water brushes: the first water brushes are in! They're useful to paint waves, for a lake, a sea or an ocean.
- Tree leaves builder: a nice brush to quickly add detailed leaves to a piece of concept art.

### Version 7 (Oct 2016)

- 2 Rock presets: draw small, round and stylized rocks with Rock_builder_stylized, and detail them with the Rock_detail brush
- 3 special presets for shading: the special_shadow brush allows you to stamp simple round shadows, to place under characters and small assets. The other 2 brushes are directional shading brushes, with a sharp and a soft side.
- 2 pencil-looking brushes: one for sketching, and one for shading.
- Updated paint_old preset: I remade the preset from scratch. It is at least twice as fast, and strokes are more consistent.

### Version 6 (Sep 2016)

- 4 pixel art deform tools: pixel art-friendly Grow, Shrink, Move and Swirl tools
- 2 cloud builder brushes: the first builders are here! These presets will help you paint accurate sprite silhouettes in no time. These will work for both stylized and realistic clouds.
- 2 smoke brushes: for when you need to achieve a textured smoky effect. Also useful to add definition to materials.
- Text-based install guide (pdf)
- An intro to brush families (pdf)
