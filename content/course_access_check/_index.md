# Course Access Check

Here you can check if your connection can access all the resources necessary to follow GDQuest courses.

### Essential:

- [School](https://school.gdquest.com/opengraph-image.png): the main site to access lessons, quizzes, and track your progress. 
- [Projects](https://aipqadxyfpdcvlwpnxbu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/test/gdquest-logo.svg): necessary to download the project files.

### Non-Essential:

- [Videos](https://player.vimeo.com/favicon.ico): those serve to occasionally illustrate a point in the lessons.
