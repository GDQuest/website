Do you want to **become an independent game developer**? You came to the right place!

At GDQuest, we teach you **game creation with the free and open-source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)**. 

We give you the tools and educational resources you need to learn everything about the engine while developing the core skills you need to make unique games.

We have plenty of free tutorials for you to get started, to the point it can be a bit hard to know which to follow first.

That's why we made a free 7-day course.

Every day, you'll get an email with carefully selected tutorials and guides to get up to speed with Godot quickly.

## The problem with most tutorials

There's a ton of free tutorials out there, but they often just teach you one trick in isolation and rarely go past beginner-level.

Also, while they show you _how_ to do things, they rarely explain _why_.

You can follow dozens, but when it comes to making your own games, _you don't know where to start_. 

That's because you learned recipes, which is fine and useful. We also teach powerful tricks that way.

But recipes alone will only get you so far if you lack the foundations. 

To become an independent game developer, you need more than that. You need to hone fundamental skills, including:

1. Understanding the interaction between **design and code**.
1. **Creative problem-solving**.
1. **Project management**.

And that even if you want to make games for fun. That's because what makes a game pleasant is its design, the systems that rule it.

You express and implement the design in code, and translating your ideas into a computer program is a complex problem you have to break down into a multitude of smaller issues and tasks.

And to tackle many tasks, you need to decide where to start and how to organize them.

**Those skills are essential because they'll follow you all your life.** You may switch game engine, you may even change career: they'll always benefit you.

And we're here to help you acquire them.

## At your service since 2015

<img src="/about/img/nathan.png" alt="Nathan's picture" style="float: right; border-radius: 200px;" />

Hey, I'm Nathan. I created GDQuest in 2015 to help you learn game art and game development with free and open-source software.

I made hundreds of [video tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/gdquest), where we have **more than 145,000 subscribers**.

The project grew since then, and we're now, we're a team of experienced game developers, tutors, and Free Software enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and supporting Godot, our engine of choice.

_New to Godot? I made a 5-minute video to get you started._

We not only use Godot: we directly contribute to the program and its ecosystem, including the official documentation. In 2020, I even got hired to write its [new Getting Started series](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-docs-improvements-report).

Between our videos, [written tutorials](/tutorial), and dozens of [open-source game demos and tools](/tools), we already have the largest base of free resources and tutorials for Godot.
