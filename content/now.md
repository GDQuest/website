_Last update on July 3, 2017_

I am near Switzerland, in the French Alps.

Lately, I'm:

- Contributing to the open source game engine Godot
- Working on a game creation course after a [recent success on Kickster](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/make-professional-2d-games-godot-engine-online-cou)
- Coding a blender add-on to make videos efficiently
- Working on the [GDquest Krita brushes]({{< ref "product/krita/brushes/index.md" >}})
- Studying Japanese kanji, at a rate of 1 to 2 every day
- Trail running and boxing

I'm open to collab opportunities with fellow content creators and game creation tutors! It's fun, motivating, and people [seem to love that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNOpMMbeNk). So feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:nathan@gdquest.com)!
