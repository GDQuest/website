## Become a better game developer!

With this course, you will learn to **create the main mechanics** and systems in
your own games, using the Free [Godot Game Engine](//godotengine.org/).

Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game
step-by-step, this one will teach you **professional game creation techniques**
you can apply to any type of game!
