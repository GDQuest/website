## Become a better game developer!

With this course, you will learn to **create the main mechanics** and systems in your own games, using the Free [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game step-by-step, this one will teach you **professional game creation techniques** you can apply to any type of game!

> Purchasing the Pro course is the best investment I have made. I can't imagine how much time it saved me compared to trying to learn from ad-hoc tutorials.
>
> What I love most about it is that I feel that I am learning best practices for Godot that I can translate to different styles of games. For me, this has been the best way for me to learn Godot from scratch.
