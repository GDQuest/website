We’ve finished making changes to the **official 2D platformer demo**! 

This is a proof of concept project and we'd like to give other demos found in the [official demo repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects) a similar treatment. This demo felt like a great place to start and show how the [guidelines written by the team](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/) can be used.

## What's changed?

The assets have stayed the same but almost everything underneath has been re-written.

{{< youtube "77CiZ-5JKfc" >}}

The changes include:

- Project folders have been restructured and tidied
- Static typing is used throughout the project to help with error detection and possible performance boosts in later Godot updates
- Gun and Player logic has been decoupled to allow us to reuse them easily
- The Player is faster and more responsive
- The Player can now travel with moving platforms and no longer slides down slopes
- Physics collision layers have been reorganised
- The tileset is no longer generated by a separate scene in favour of using the tileset editor 
- Platforms have been reworked and simplified to easily add dynamic movement

## What's next?

We hope these changes will be merged into the official demos soon and we can start improving the other demos in a similar way. 

Until then, feel free to [check out these changes](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-kickstarter-2019/tree/master/platformer-2d-rework) and let us know what you think!
