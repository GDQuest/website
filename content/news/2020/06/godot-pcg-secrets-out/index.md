Check out our new series on procedural generation! This new advanced course will teach you to generate **procedural game worlds** with the free game engine Godot.

## What you will learn

In this course, you will learn to:

- Design and layer algorithms to create unique game worlds with code
- Use great programming practices to keep your code short and easy to read
- Make the most of random number generators

All that using Godot's GDScript programming language.

## Pre-requisites

To follow this course, you should be comfortable with code.

You should:

- Be able to work with Godot's editor. Make sure you know how to add nodes, resources within nodes, and use the Inspector.
- Have strong GDScript foundations.

If you have no experience with Godot, we wrote a complete [Free Godot guide for beginners](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guides/learn-godot/beginner/) to get you started.

## Early Access

Get your hands on the course now for a **lower price** as we create new tutorials. The price will increase with the next update.

Once you bought the course, you get **lifetime free updates**. All the new content we add will come at no extra cost!

In this first release, the course covers the **Random Walker algorithm**, as seen in Spelunky. It's a general-purpose level generator that works for all sorts of games, 2D and 3D, although in the course's example, we cover a side-scrolling game.

We are working on the following topics for the next updates:

- Deterministic infinite world generation
- Guiding randomness with layered blue noise
- Generating procedural equipment and stats
- Shader-based world map with biomes

## Free and Open-Source

The code from this project is available under the MIT license. In short, you can use it and modify it freely, even in commercial projects.
