During the [Godot 2D Secrets Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/godot-2d-secrets-level-up-your-game-creation-skills) campaign, we worked hard to revitalize our YouTube channel, write new tutorials, and code new game demos in preparation for the course.

You can links to all resources we created below.

## Free and Open-Source demos

The first four demos are games we will cover in the course Godot 2D Secrets. But we also did some work on procedural generation and shaders.

1. [Rhythm game](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-2d-rhythm)
1. [Real-time Tactical Combat](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-2d-tactical-space-combat)
1. [2D Simulation](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-2d-simulation-survival)
1. [2D JRPG Combat](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-2d-jrpg-combat)
1. [Infinite PCG](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-procedural-generation)
1. [Shaders](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-shaders)

## Written guides and tutorials

François wrote about debugging and performance optimization, two topics that many of you requested, while Razvan wrote two articles about choosing game engines:

1. [Getting started with debugging]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/gdscript/debugging/index.md" >}})
1. [Measuring code performances]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/gdscript/optimization-measure/index.md" >}})
1. [Making the most of Godot's speed]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/gdscript/optimization-engine/index.md" >}})
1. [Optimizing GDScript code]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/gdscript/optimization-code/index.md" >}})
1. [3D rendering optimization]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/3d/optimization-3d/index.md" >}})
1. [Game Engine Basics]({{< ref "tutorial/getting-started/learn-to/game-engine-basics/index.md" >}})
1. [Choosing the right game engine]({{< ref "tutorial/getting-started/learn-to/choosing-a-game-engine/index.md" >}})

## New videos on our channel

I tried to put out multiple videos to breathe some life into the channel again. Some of the videos are meant to promote Godot or Free and Open-Source software, while others are tutorials or overviews of our projects:

1. [Godot Explained in 5 Minutes](https://youtu.be/KjX5llYZ5eQ)
1. [Laser Beam in Godot in 1 Minute](https://youtu.be/dg0CQ6NPDn8)
1. [The 7 Programs I Use to Make Games](https://youtu.be/eRtArIvrsI0)
1. [Godot VS Game Maker](https://youtu.be/3KKeFK0NHc8)
1. [8 Godot Tutorial Channels You Should Watch](https://youtu.be/LbORGmdJCfQ)
1. [I Started Making A JRPG Combat System - Indie Devlog](https://youtu.be/y6k0NaHgjXo)
1. [Hired to Work on Godot's Documentation: The Plan](https://youtu.be/eBQSkGdG8zA)
1. [More Godot Shaders: Free and Open-Source](https://youtu.be/YsKfMih0gHY)

1. [World Generation in Our Space Game Demo: Godot Code Breakdown](https://youtu.be/5oqGvKIj4fI)

We're going to create more demos for [Godot 2D Secrets](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/godot-2d-secrets-level-up-your-game-creation-skills), and we still have content planned for our other Godot Secrets courses.
