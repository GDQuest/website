In this tutorial, you will learn to implement three different movements for your characters in Godot:

1. Rotating and moving forward or backward, as seen in the classic space shooter _Asteroids_.
2. Moving in eight directions.
3. Using steering to make the motion smooth and organic.

You can find the full source code of the project [here](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-mini-tuts-demos/tree/master/2d/top-down-movement).

## Input actions

We use input actions to link a specific event (keystrokes, mouse, or joystick interactions) with an action in our game.

For instance, if we want our character to jump when we press the space key, right-click, or the gamepad's _X_ button, we should link an action to these three events.

To create an action named _right_ open _Project -> Project Settings... -> Input Map_ write in the _Action_ field _right_ and press the _Add_ button. You can see this action has appeared in the list below.

Now, to link events to trigger this action, click on the + button you can find at the end of the field _right_ (the one you have just created). Add one _Key_ for the right arrow and another one for the _D_ key.

Finally, as we want to support analog movement (joysticks), add a _Joy Axis_ to the right.

You can review the rest of the actions you have to specify in the following image.

## Setting up the Player Scene

First, we'll create a base scene we can use to implement every movement.

We create a scene with a _KinematicBody2D_ named _PlayerTopDown_ as the root and two children: a _CollisionShape2D_ and an _AnimatedSprite_. We use an _AnimatedSprite_ here to change the character's texture depending on the movement direction.

![Player Scene](images/player_nodes.png)

In the _Inspector_, add a _New SpriteFrames_ in the `Frames` property of the _AnimatedSprite_ with all your character's textures. 

![New SpriteFrames](images/animated_sprite_1.png)

Remember the different sprites' indices, as you will have to match them with the directions in the code.

## Moving like a ship in space, as in Asteroids

Let's start with the asteroids' movement as it's the shortest and simplest.

We want some spaceship that rotates when we press `rotate_left` or `rotate_right`, moves forward when we press `up`, and backward when we press `down`.

In this tutorial, notice how we use `Input.get_action_strength()` to calculate the player's input direction. This function gives us support for analog controllers, like joysticks, allowing the player to move more precisely than with the keyboard.

The function will return `1.0` if you press a key on the keyboard and a value between `0.0` and `1.0` when using a joystick. This is why we can directly do subtractions with it.

Attach a script to the _PlayerTopDown_ node with the following code to implement this movement.

```gdscript
# Movement where the character rotates and moves forward or backward.
extends KinematicBody2D

# Movement speed in pixels per second.
export var speed := 500
# Rotation speed in radians per second.
export var angular_speed := 5.0


func _physics_process(delta):
	# See how we're using Input.get_action_strength() to calculate the direction we rotate.
	# The value will be in the [-1.0, 1.0] range.
	var rotate_direction := Input.get_action_strength("rotate_right") - Input.get_action_strength("rotate_left")
	rotation += rotate_direction * angular_speed * delta
	# Below, we calculate the forward or backward move direction and directly multiply it to calculate a velocity.
	# `transform.y` stores the node's local axes, allowing us to move it in the direction it's currently facing.
	var velocity := (Input.get_action_strength("down") - Input.get_action_strength("up")) * transform.y * speed
	move_and_slide(velocity)
```

## Top-down movement

To implement a top-down movement in eight directions, replace your _PlayerTopDown_ node's script with the following code. 

Below, we introduce a function to update our character's sprite. We also normalize our direction vector. Doing this ensures it always has a length of `1.0` (or `0.0` if the player isn't pressing any movement key).

Why? When you press both right and down without normalizing the vector, the direction calculation below will result in `Vector2(1, 1)`. Such a vector has a length of about `1.4` (it's the diagonal of a square of width `1.0`). But when you only press the right key, the vector would be `Vector2(1.0, 0.0)` and have a length of `1.0`. In that case, the character would end up moving 40% faster when going diagonally compared to moving left, right, up, or down. The `Vector2.normalized()` method prevents this issue.

```gdscript
extends KinematicBody2D

# Movement speed in pixels per second.
export var speed := 500

# We map a direction to a frame index of our AnimatedSprite node's sprite frames.
# See how we use it below to update the character's look direction in the game.
var _sprites := {Vector2.RIGHT: 1, Vector2.LEFT: 2, Vector2.UP: 3, Vector2.DOWN: 4}
var _velocity := Vector2.ZERO

onready var animated_sprite: AnimatedSprite = $AnimatedSprite


func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
	# Once again, we call `Input.get_action_strength()` to support analog movement.
	var direction := Vector2(
		# This first line calculates the X direction, the vector's first component.
		Input.get_action_strength("right") - Input.get_action_strength("left"),
		# And here, we calculate the Y direction. Note that the Y-axis points 
		# DOWN in games.
		# That is to say, a Y value of `1.0` points downward.
		Input.get_action_strength("down") - Input.get_action_strength("up")
	)
	# When aiming the joystick diagonally, the direction vector can have a length 
	# greater than 1.0, making the character move faster than our maximum expected
	# speed. When that happens, we limit the vector's length to ensure the player 
	# can't go beyond the maximum speed.
	if direction.length() > 1.0:
		direction = direction.normalized()
	move_and_slide(speed * direction)


# The code below updates the character's sprite to look in a specific direction.
func _unhandled_input(event):
	if event.is_action_pressed("right"):
		_update_sprite(Vector2.RIGHT)
	elif event.is_action_pressed("left"):
		_update_sprite(Vector2.LEFT)
	elif event.is_action_pressed("down"):
		_update_sprite(Vector2.DOWN)
	elif event.is_action_pressed("up"):
		_update_sprite(Vector2.UP)


func _update_sprite(direction: Vector2) -> void:
	animated_sprite.frame = _sprites[direction]
```

## Smoother movement with steering behaviors

There's a series of little movement algorithms for games called steering behaviors that game developers use a lot. You can use them to smooth out your characters' movements and give them a bit of inertia. 

For this new movement, you need to add a new variable at the beginning of the previous script (`friction`), which will be controlling the inertia of the movement. You can play with this value to see how it affects your character movement.

A greater value will make your character react more rapidly. Lower values imply a higher time to reach the maximum speed or stop the movement.

```gdscript
# A factor that controls the character's inertia.
export var friction = 0.18
```

Change the previous `_physics_process` with this new method:

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	var direction := Vector2(
		Input.get_action_strength("right") - Input.get_action_strength("left"),
		Input.get_action_strength("down") - Input.get_action_strength("up")
	)
	if direction.length() > 1.0:
		direction = direction.normalized()
	# Using the follow steering behavior.
	var target_velocity = direction * speed
	_velocity += (target_velocity - _velocity) * friction
	_velocity = move_and_slide(_velocity)
```

You can use a steering behavior to arrive at a target point smoothly and accelerate and decelerate gradually.

These behaviors are commonly used for AI but also in arcade racing games and much more.

## Bonus: loading different scenes with a keyboard shortcut

In the open-source demo we prepared for you, you can load different mini-game scenes by pressing <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, or <kbd>3</kbd> on your keyboard. Here's how we achieved that, as a bonus.

There are three scenes to test all the movements with a similar structure but changing the player node. These scenes are composed of an instantiated scene (_Level1_) with some obstacles, a _Sprite_ for the level background, and a _StaticBody2D_ to set the limits of the level.

They have another instantiated scene (_SceneIndicator_) to show a title with the name of the movement we are testing.

![Scene structure for testing the movements](images/general_scene_nodes.png)

And finally, they have four particle emitters to generate little white squares you see moving in the back (just for aesthetic reasons).

![Scene structure for testing the movements](images/general_scene.png)

We have changed the background default color of the scene. You can do this in _Project -> Project Settings... -> Rendering -> Environment -> Default Clear Color_.

![Changing the default background color](images/background_color.png)

And finally, the following script changes the scene depending on the number you pressed (1-3):

```gdscript
extends Node2D

var topdown_scene := "res://Levels/DemoTopdown.tscn"
var topdown_acceleration_scene := "res://Levels/DemoTopdownAcceleration.tscn"
var rotate_move_scene := "res://Levels/DemoRotate.tscn"


func _unhandled_input(event):
	if event.is_action_pressed("load_topdown"):
		get_tree().change_scene(topdown_scene)
	elif event.is_action_pressed("load_topdown_acc"):
		get_tree().change_scene(topdown_acceleration_scene)
	elif event.is_action_pressed("load_rotate_move"):
		get_tree().change_scene(rotate_move_scene)
```

Remember to add these three actions to the project's input maps, as we have seen before.
