In this video, you will get to create collectible coins that increase your score, portals that teleport the player between levels, and will do level design, so you can test your character, your enemy, and have fun with it.

Through this, you will get to see the tilemap and learn one way to do level design in Godot. You will use the area 2D node for collectibles, learn about changing scene at runtime, and more.
