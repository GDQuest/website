This third part focuses entirely on the user interface and gives the player the ability to pause the game, which you will need to do in pretty much every project.

## What next?

After this, I recommend our [tactical RPG movement series](/tutorial/godot/2d/tactical-rpg-movement/). It's completely free and focuses on grid-based movement, in a demo inspired by Fire Emblem and Advance Wars.

Our [intro to steering behaviors](/tutorial/godot/2d/intro-to-steering-behaviors/) is also really useful if you want to see something different, more related to artificial intelligence and top-down movement. These movement functions are super helpful in game development.
