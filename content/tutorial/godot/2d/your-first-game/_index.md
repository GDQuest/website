You will learn to:

- Code a platform game character that can move and jump.

And more! All that in 2d. The course is compatible with **Godot 3.1+**.

## Pre-requisites

This course is for **beginners**. It gives many details about programming and how Godot work, teaching you good practices from the start.

While this is a step-by-step course, you should know:

1. The basics of Godot's GDScript language. We have a [Free GDScript Intro](/tutorial/godot/gdscript/intro/) lesson to get you started.
2. How to use Godot's editor.

## Extended edition

We have a **premium edition** of this course with **extra lessons**, assignments, questions and answers, and more. In the extended version, you will learn to:

- Add 2D lights to your levels.
- Create bumpers to jump high.
- Add slope support.
- Use UI themes to improve the look of your interface.

It only costs **15$** and comes with questions and answers. The videos are cut into bite-sized lessons to help you learn at your pace, DRM-free downloadable content, and a 60-day refund warranty.
