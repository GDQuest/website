## Your questions

### What's a ZIP file?

A ZIP file is like a folder that can hold multiple files or directories (folders inside folders) but as a single file on your computer, making it much easier to share online and download.

It also stores data in a compressed format. This means that the ZIP file takes up less space than the individual files or directories would, making it faster to download, to upload, and more lightweight to store.

### What's a Godot project?

A Godot project is a collection of files and folders that represent a game or application made using the Godot game engine. It contains all the assets, code, and settings of a game project or computer program.
