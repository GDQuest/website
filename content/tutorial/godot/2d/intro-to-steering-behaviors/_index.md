title: Intro to Steering Behaviors in Godot
type: course
---

How do you make something move smoothly? Do you need complex pathfinding, BÃ©zier curves, or complicated math?

Not at all! With steering behaviors, you can make both player-controlled characters and AI agents move smoothly and beautifully with just a few lines of code.

You can also use these techniques to create snake-like creatures. They have many applications!

This series will introduce you to steering behaviors in Godot.

You'll learn:

- How to make a character follow another.
- How to follow a moving point and smoothly arrive to a desired position.
- How to make a chain of AI agents follow each other and, in particular, follow their leader.

While we will use vector math, you only need a basic understanding of what vectors are and how they work. Middle school level math is enough to follow along with this series.
