With Godot 4, to help you get your foot in the door, we developed an <abbr title="Educational Technology">EdTech</abbr> called **Godot Tours** that allows you to learn interactively, step-by-step, directly inside the Godot Editor.

![Screenshot of one of the first steps of the tour, showing the running game and a bubble inviting you to run the game.](tour-101-screenshot-02.webp)

In this first completely free tour, we take you on a quick guided walk through the user interface and help you find your way around the editor and break the ice with Godot.

Download the tour project files:

### How to use

1. Click the download button above to download a Godot project containing the tour.
2. Import the project in Godot. You will need **Godot 4.4** or later to run the tour.

Godot may restart automatically to update the editor. Godot Tours relies on specific editor settings to give you a smooth experience, and the editor may need to restart to apply them.

You should then see a menu giving you access to tour *101: The Godot Editor*. Click the tour in the menu to select it and then click the *START LEARNING* button at the bottom to get started.

### How to import Godot project files in the Godot editor

The download button above downloads a ZIP file that Godot can import directly for you. To import it in Godot, you need to:

1. Open the Godot Project Manager
2. Click the *Import* button at the top-left of the window.
3. Navigate to the location of the ZIP file you downloaded and select it.
4. Click the *Open* button.
5. Select a folder where you want Godot to store the project (or use the default location) and click *Import*.

## Your questions

### What's a ZIP file?

A ZIP file is like a folder that can hold multiple files or directories (folders inside folders) but as a single file on your computer, making it much easier to share online and download.

It also stores data in a compressed format. This means that the ZIP file takes up less space than the individual files or directories would, making it faster to download, to upload, and more lightweight to store.

### What's a Godot project?

A Godot project is a collection of files and folders that represent a game or application made using the Godot game engine. It contains all the assets, code, and settings of a game project or computer program.
