Every Godot version brings a breadth of new features. It was especially the case for Godot 3.1.

If you're not constantly following the news, it's difficult to keep track of them. The documentation does not always keep up.

In this series, we go through each new and updated feature one by one, so you know what's available and how everything works.

If you're looking for more general Godot courses, we prepared completely free series for you:

1. If you're fairly new to programming, check out our [getting started series for beginners](/get-started/).
1. If you're an experienced developer, you'll certainly like our [developer's learning path to Godot](/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/developer/).
