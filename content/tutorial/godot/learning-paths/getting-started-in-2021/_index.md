You want to learn Godot or game development but don't know how to get started? Or you tried some tutorials already, but you don't feel like you understand how the engine works or how to code your games?

This **completely free course** will give you the tools you need to make games with Godot.

Through detailed explanations and hands-on, step-by-step projects, you will learn the 4 most essential concepts you need to understand in Godot.

The first videos give you a general introduction to the engine, nodes, scenes, the scene tree, and signals, the interface, and progressively build up towards creating _two complete game projects_, one in 2D and one in 3D.

It will only take you a couple of hours total, and by the end, you will have coded two complete games from scratch.

{{< note >}}
The course is still in the making and one new lesson's coming out weekly.
