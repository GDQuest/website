In this final lesson in the course, you'll code a 3D game from start to finish in Godot.

It builds upon the 2D game you created in the previous lesson, which will help you see the similitudes and differences when coding 2D and 3D games in Godot.

We changed the mechanics to keep the game fresh, though.

You will learn to:

1. Use kinematic bodies to move characters and detect collisions.
1. Code a jump and squash mechanic.
1. Use areas as hurt boxes, causing the player to die when an enemy touches it on the ground.
1. Use code to spawn enemies around the screen randomly, in 3D.
1. Animate 3D models using Godot's built-in animation editor.

You'll learn to spawn random monsters, jump and squash mechanics, animation, and more.

You can download the starter project here: [Squash the Creeps 3D starter assets](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-getting-started-2021/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## What next?

You got to the end of this free course to get started with Godot. Congratulations!

Now, you're probably wondering: "what should I do next?"

Here are two actions you can take to keep learning and improving:

1. If you haven't already, subscribe to our [free getting started with game development 7-day course](/get-started/). It covers topics we couldn't talk about here, including how to practice efficiently and more Godot learning resources I recommend.
2. You'll find many more curated free tutorials to keep learning Godot in our [Godot beginner's learning path](/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/beginner/).
