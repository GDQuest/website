This is a beginner-level presentation to help you understand Godot's GDScript programming language and the essential programming concepts that apply to many languages. This one-hour free lesson explains how things like variables, functions, type hints, and so on work.

I made this video to complement other learning resources and our many hands-on tutorials, where you will get to practice GDScript. 

It's all about programming fundamentals and will help you better understand every other tutorial.

It's a useful page to bookmark and to watch and rewatch as you learn to create games.

If you want a hands-on, step-by-step tutorial, you should check our [free complete beginner platformer game course](/tutorial/godot/2d/your-first-game/).
