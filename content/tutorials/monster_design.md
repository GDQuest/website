# Intro to monster design for 2-D games

The intro to monster design is the first free training released on GDquest. In about 40 minutes, it will **run you through the thought process a game artist might follow to design monsters**. It both covers the thought process behind the design of a monster and an example of monster drawing with pen, paper and Krita.
